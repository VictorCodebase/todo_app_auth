*Some key terms you might need to be familiar with getting to this:
*
* Libraries: Pre-written code that you can download (using: pip install library-name) and use in our code to make work easier
* 
* Frameworks take the concepts of libraries a step further. They bundle together libraries and other tools a developer might need to develop
* a solution of a certain nature. Some examples youll definitely come across are: Flask(python), Node(JS), Django(python)... You can check them out
*
* SQL (Standard Query Language) is a scripting language used to work with databases like SQLite, mySQL, MariaDb etc
* SQL syntax tends to differ differently from db to db depending on what features the database supports

# sqlite3 is a library that allows python to easily create and interact with SQLite databases.
# To use this you mut have at one point in this project ran: pip install sqlite3 (if you experience issues installing, try using a virtual environment)
import sqlite3 

# flask is a framework. From this you can see it offers a number of libraries all packed together (these are not all the libraries in flas definitely)
# 1. Session is a library that handles user sessions. Our server is NOT STATELESS. Meaning we keep track of who accesses the website by requiring a login
# 2. redirect is a library that has code that enable you (the dev) to redirect a user. So lets say a user tries to access a page they shouldn't, you can redirect them away
# 3. render_template is a special one. to use this, you html must be in a folder in this code called: templates. if not render template wont help you
# 4. Finall request gives you the ability to read what has been sent in the body of the message sent using POST
from flask import Flask, session, redirect, render_template, request


#Here we create an instance of flask. This shall make it possible for us to easily manage the backend. 
#To appreciate how much easier Flask makes this whole process, try checking out the manual processðŸ’”ðŸ’”

# This is necessary for session management. It should generally be kept safe

# Ensure the database is available before anything
def init_db():

    # We create a python variable connection. This shall store the connection between python and the specified db (users.db)
    connection = sqlite3.connect("users.db")

    # The cursor method in sqlite3 gives you all you need to run SQL scrips within python!
    # Thats why its the first variable we create after connection
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    # Extra info: a database is made up of multiple tables. think of them as pages in a book. Each page stores its own unique records
    #
    # Here cursor runs this SQL script. It creates 2 empty tables. Notice that it does not add any data to the tables
    # Notice that the table tasks has the line "FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)"
    # This line can be interprated this way:
    #   - FOREIGN KEY (user_id): this means the column user_id matches (references) another column in another table
    #   - REFERENCES users(id): this specifies that the id in the user_id matches with the column called id, in the table called users
    #
    # The other lines shouldnt be too hard to decipher
    # 
    # Extra info: this ensures that we are sure the tables exist in the database before we try reading or modifying them
